DESCRIPTION:You're invited to our Socratic Seminar Meetup! This event is designed for dynamic and engaging discussions centered around Bitcoin. Modeled after Socrates' method of inquiry\, we'll foster an open environment where everyone's voice is valued. Through thought-provoking questions and shared insights\, we aim to explore diverse perspectives\, challenge ideas\, and deepen our understanding together. This meetup is perfect for those eager to enhance their critical thinking skills or simply engage in stimulating conversation. The main goal of a Socratic Seminar is not to debate or argue but to deeply explore ideas\, understand different perspectives\, and collaboratively construct meaning from specific Bitcoin-related text or topic at hand. Join us for an interactive and respectful dialogue where everyone's contributions shape our collective exploration of ideas!
