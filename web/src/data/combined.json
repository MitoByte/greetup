Summerfest Tech continues to champion the regional business community, while shining the spotlight on Wisconsin\u2019s growing reputation as a tech hub, highlighting the growth and opportunity in the region. Programming from local, regional, and national speakers, as well as a cash-prize pitch competition, connects the tech community around relevant topics. Summerfest Tech will be held June 27-29, 2023, free of charge, in-person and available virtually.\n\n**About ValorTech**\nLocated within Milwaukee's largest carrier hotel & data center, the historic Wells Building, ValorTech\u00ae delivers our clients military-grade IT security, resources and performance.\n\nWe're bred from world-class service & structure and are proud to be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOB).

Above our passion for coffee and beer, we both share the desire to create a culture that connects us with the people that consume it. Vennture is a hybrid brewery, coffee roastery, taproom and cafe.\n\nThe idea started as we explored the world of coffee and beer. We thought, what if we created space that combines best of both, a coffee shop and a brewery? That would be the best place ever. We put everything we had (literally everything) into making our dream a reality, and in 2018 \"The Night Crew\" (the name we gave ourselves during build out) hung up our tools and picked up new ones and started making coffee and beer.\n\nIn the 5 years we've been open we've seen a lot of growth, hired some amazing people, met a lot of new friends, witnessed first hand owning a business during a global pandemic, and fostered a community that keeps us going each and every day.",

We are looking for sponsors to see if we can, but for the time being we won't be providing anything. Though, Formlabs is in the amazing 3rd Ward with tons of food options.\n\n**Are there prizes?**\nIf you present your project progress at the end of the day, you will be entered into a drawing for some small prizes. Typically these are fun / small things such as board games, notepads, etc.\n\n**Where should I park?**\nThere are street parking available, paid parking garage options, and public transportation stops in the area. You can use apps like SpotHero to help find parking ahead of time if need be.\n\n**Agenda**\nDoors Open - Coffee\n8:30 AM - 8:45 AM\n\n***\n\n**Doors Open**\nFind a good spot to set up shop for the day.\n9:00 AM\n\n***\n\n**Work Time**\nShort introduction about who you are, and what you plan to work on.\n9:30 AM - 12:00 PM\n\n***\n\n**Lunch**\nWork on your project.
