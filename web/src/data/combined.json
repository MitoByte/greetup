Bring a coffee and your latest project if you'd like to share.\n\nWe're meeting on Discord for it's better video sharing capabilities. If you don't already have an account, no worries!, you'll be prompted to provide one upon joining the channel.\n\nHere's our typical agenda:\n1. Idle Chatter\n2. Area Events and Happenings\n3. Scheduling Presentations (making sure all attendees who want to present have time)\n4. Presentations\n\nWe like to take screenshots of the presentations to post here on Meetup.com, so others get a sense of what we do and the cool projects that come through here. Screenshots are attributed with the name of the work (as best known) and the presenter's name or online handle, as per their preference. We're guessing that if you're wanting to show off your projects in the meetup, it isn't a stretch to have a screenshot posted here on the site as well. BUT! If you'd rather not have your work posted on Meetup.com, or you have another concern, please let a host know and we'll accommodate you as best we can.",

If you have any business applications that could be enhanced by adding the ability to search your data (database or documents) using a ChatGPT like interaction, then RAG may be the starting point for you.\nIn this session, I will do a quick introduction of the parts of a RAG implementation - though I do assume you are already familiar with what Large Language Models (LLM's) are and how to use them. The majority of the session will be spent looking at different ways to implement the RAG pattern using .NET with Azure and OpenAI services. We'll start with a simple na\u00efve implementation and get into more detail on ways to improve the functionality.\nDemos include:\n\n1. A simple local Blazor web application using SQL Server and Azure Open AI to understand RAG, vectors/embeddings\n2. A full featured RAG application with a Blazor front-end and Azure AI Search for storing vectors for searching unstructured data (ie. Pdf files)\n3. An additional demo that shows RAG with structured data (semantic search on data from a database) also written in .NET\n\nWatch live on YouTube if you are not able to be there: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMX-qyRuAzE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMX-qyRuAzE)\n\nLocation Sponsor: **[Concurrency](https://concurrency.com/)**\nFood Sponsor: **[TEKSystems](https://www.teksystems.com/)**",
