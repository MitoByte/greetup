The software development industry is one of knowledge workers, combine that with an alarming amount of developers suffering of imposter syndrome and we get the \"yes I know what that means\", instead of asking for an explanation.\n\nIn this session we will go through terminologies like tree-shaking, linking, just-in-time, garbage collection and many others that I have discovered people are pretending to know about.

The standard has been under development by the International Society of Automation since 2002, and is constantly evolving. While the reference number is well known in control systems security circles, detailed knowledge varies, including what it covers, what it proscribes, and, perhaps most importantly, how to implement it. In this presentation, Steve Mustard will give an overview of ISA/IEC62443, help navigate through the documents, discuss where to use it and how to implement and validate it. This presentation will be of interest to control system product vendors seeking to demonstrate security by design, asset owners seeking to secure their control system environments, and integrators/consultants looking to manage projects involving control systems security.\nSpeaker:\nSteve Mustard, President & CEO at National Automation and CS2AI Senior Fellow, Inc.

We believe that every child deserves a chance to succeed and be happy. That's why we work to provide them with the resources they need to grow, learn, and thrive.\nSpecifically, ValorCares supports and contributes to educational funding for children of fallen heroes. Join us in our support of vets and their families by bringing two non-perishable food items to donate.\n\n**About Lakefront Brewery**\n*Creating natural, sustainable, innovative food and beverages while celebrating Milwaukee hospitality to our visiting guests.\"\\*\n\nAccording to Brewery President Russ Klisch, the whole brewery started with his brother, Jim. Near his birthday, Jim expressed interest in beer making, and Russ humored him with the gift of a homebrewing book. To Russ\u2019 surprise, Jim read the book, and brewed a beer. By Russ\u2019 account, Jim was no gourmet cook, but he made a pretty good beer. Impressed, Russ decided he could brew one better. In short, sibling rivalry and common interest lead to both brothers entering homebrewing contests and winning awards. It wasn\u2019t long before family and friends encouraged them to turn their hobby into a business.\nThe Brothers decided to start small and chose a location within walking distance of their home: the site of a former bakery in Milwaukee\u2019s Riverwest neighborhood. They began brewing with 55-gallon, stainless steel drums and used dairy equipment. On December 2, 1987 they sold their first barrel of beer to a tavern within \u201crolling distance\u201d of the brewery.\nLakefront\u2019s production grew with their popularity: by 1988, sales jumped to 72 barrels; by 1989, 125 barrels; and sales began doubling after that. In 1990, owner Russ Klisch built his own bottling machine and began bottling their beer. The Brothers brought in more used equipment to meet the ever-expanding demand; a visiting food critic once commented that Lakefront was a \u201cFrankenstein operation\u201d, because all their equipment had lived and died in a previous life. In 1998, production had reached nearly 3,000 barrels in the small 3,600 square foot space, and Jim and Russ decided it was time to move.\nThe search was on for a new location and the City of Milwaukee had a building to sell. In 1908, Lakefront Brewery\u2019s current building housed the Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company\u2019s coal-fired power plant. In 1998, the City considered tearing down the old power plant location, unless a non-industrial business was interested in the location. The City thought beer making an appropriate industry, and allowed them to buy the building and move in.\nThe move was completed, and additions were made to both the building and brewery. In 2000, Russ replaced the homemade brewing equipment with a real brew house. Production has increased throughout the years, and in 2017 had reached 46,848 barrels. Lakefront currently offers 20 different beers available in over 30 states and distributed to Ukraine, South Korea, Sweden, China and Canada. The brewery is known for its innovative ales and lagers, as well as its infamous brewery tour.\nLakefront\u2019s pioneering spirit has created many U.S. brewing-industry firsts. Among these, the brewery introduced the first beer in the United States made from 100% in-state-grown ingredients with the barley, wheat, hops and a first-of-its-kind, indigenous Wisconsin yeast strain (Wisconsinite Summer Weiss), the first certified organic brewery, producing the country\u2019s oldest certified organic beer (Organic E.S.B.), and the first government-certified, gluten-free beer (New Grist).\nLakefront Brewery has one of the most popular brewery tours in the United States; over 80,000 people tour the brewery each year. Lakefront was one of the first\u2014if not the first\u2014to offer beer at the beginning, during, and after the tour instead of requiring visitors to wait until the end.",
